# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 
To create a binary classifer to predict whether or not applicants will be successful if funded by the non-profit, Alphabet Soup. Alphabet soup provides funding to organizations that promote social and environmental improvements. Not every organization that is funded has a potitive impact with the amount they are granted. We want to be able to avoid providing money to organizations through this binary classifier. 

## Results: 
### Data Preprocessing
1. What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
- For this model, our target is to whether or not an organization will be successful if given funding from Alphabet soup. 
2. What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
- Our features include: Application Type, Affiliation, Classification Use Cas, Organization, Status, Income Amout Special Considerations and Ask Amount.
3. What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
- EIN and Name are neither a target or a feature. These are both indenficiation columns and don't explain the organization other than providing information similar to an ID number. 
 
### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
1. How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?

3. Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
4. What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?


## Summary: 
Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.
